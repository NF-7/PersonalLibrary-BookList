# PersonalLibrary-BookList
Personal JS Projects

Third project in JS after just starting with learning javascript and WebDev.

The idea of the project was to create a personal collection of books (or it can really be used for any other item if we change the HTML elements).

In the app.js file, there are separators in order to easily look over the code and what every instance of it does. In the app-es6.js file the separators are not included and the code is a bit more structured in order with the DRY principle. 

Included are the functions to construct books, UI and the sessionManager, create additional buttons, etc. 

There are no limits to how many items could be added or how many can be edited or removed.

This project was instructed as very basic DOM manipulation exercise and as an additional lessons in DOM manipulation in order to deepen javascript knowledge.

Code is reusable by anyone. Open to additional suggestions regarding code usage/better coding with DRY principle in mind.
